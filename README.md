# GDP

# IMPORTANT:
USAGE: rename the main folder (before Assets, etc.) to "GDP", or Unity may not work as the files will not be synced correctly.

A game called Project MAR I did as part of Shortcut Games-a home-educated game developement group-with Al-yasa Ismail, Jake Chin, Mac and Gilly Roshak and (for a short time) Noah Sargentson-Wilk. GDP stands for Game Developement Project (not Gross Domestic Product!) and was just the name we used at the start of the project before we had decided on a final name for the game. This project was used in the Gold CREST Award myself, Al-yasa and Jake did alongside this project.
